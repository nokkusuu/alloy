# alloy
alloy is a minecraft mod[pack] manager that aims to provide simplicity while remaining fairly efficient in practice
###### NOTE: this repository currently contains early development code. the final version will behave FAR different.

## why?
currently, the most popular methods of modding minecraft are either tedious, inefficient, or downright non-functional
- the twitch/curse launcher is *extremely* temperamental
- launchers like ftb's are only focused on very specific types of *curated* modpacks
- technic requires modpack creators to upload entire zip files

alloy aims to provide an open-source solution to this problem

## what platforms are supported?
any computer that can run the java version of minecraft should be properly supported; this includes windows, macos, and linux.
